Implement three classes: Storage, Counter, and Printer. The Storage class should store an integer. The Counter class should create a thread that starts counting from 0 (0, 1, 2, 3 ...) and stores each value in the Storage class. The Printer class should create a thread that keeps reading the value in the Storage class and printing it.

Write a program that creates an instance of the Storage class and sets up a Counter and a Printer object to operate on it.
